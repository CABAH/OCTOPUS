# OCTOPUS

OCTOPUS is an OGC-compliant, web-enabled database that allow users to visualise, query, and download geochronological data along with associated geospatial (vector and raster) data layers.

It is based on open source software and allows for various levels of integration. For example, data stored in the database can be visualised via a custom web interface but also via desktop GIS applications that support OGC data-access protocols. OCTOPUS can also directly export data to various formats, including Google Earth KLM and ESRI shapefile.
